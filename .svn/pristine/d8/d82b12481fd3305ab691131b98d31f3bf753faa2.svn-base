TODO:
1. Robonato formula, use L*(t) = E^Q^A (L(t)) other than L(0).
2. Make the shift dependent on time: a_i(t) => then change shifted LMM with a_i -> Piterbarg formulatio: beta_i
   so need to chang the black formula latter to take into account the shift.
3. Test Robonato with shift != 0.
4. Implement the Piterbarg formula. 
5. Add unit-test 
6. need to move fixedLegNPV to better place...
7. MC swap pricing extremly slow ... (compared to FRA): seems the problem of integral of piecewise const fonction HGVolatility.
8. swap rate ~ MC still strange: validate with FRA, but Euler / PC, terminal ~ spot, seems no difference, strange. 
9. get_DeltaTFloatLeg not the same indexation as Libor matrix. To change it. 
10. Robonato/Piterbarg approximation can be further optimized for calibration problem.
11. get_date return a double other than a index, there is no check, it makes the code dangerous, need to delete it. 

12a. Calibration
		- debug for local calibration exact (without use of penalty), calib has to match exactly
		- for Local calibration, find a way to normalize the penalty in order to not depend in nbYear (/nbElementDiag^2)
		- attention to swaption weights, high weight has to attribute to the more liquid swaption
		
12. re-implement check_data_consistency for SwaptionMarketDataContainer, important for having save data before use

13. Create a helper index lower triangular matrice, helping to manipulate directly fron matrix indices to flat vector indices    
    instead of copy every time a flat vector to a matrix (too much time consumn) 
14. move initLibor value to LMM model ? (for simplicify equivalentShift, maybe some pricing ? )
15. Make the correlation homogeneous + piecewise constant... 

16. nativeShift is only for the Shifted_HGVolatilityFunction, it should not exist in the base class VolatilityFunction: to remove it and do the cast...

Problem:
1. Strange behavior of Robonator for longer maturity swaption formula.
2.

Question: 
1. for equivalentShift, PC shceme, should use the same equivalentShift for both predictor  and corrector  ????
2. Rebonator, Piterbard formula can only be used for ShiftedLMM but not betaLMM ?
