TODO LIST:  hope to finish everything before the end of April :) 

1. Correlation structure: 
   Implement the XY sub-diagnol correlation construction, and test the result, compare with the XY_beta correlation function, 
   test it with cliquet product. to see the impact!
2. Rewrite the shit Matrix class: maybe use the boost class, but need to enable the debug visualizer.
5. Change the name of the class: Vol + Correl -> TermStructur (Dispersion) ?  etc ...
6. need to test double, how to convert date to double (yearly) ?
7. Is it a good idea to do the triangular matrix as Adrien ? 
8. vol function: g is kept constant, to change it latter ... 
9. hgVolatilityFunction is Piecewise Constant version, when implement other version, need to implement the heritage structure. 
10. Need to think aoubt where to put the lmmTenorStructure_ ??? Now it's in every class: for example:
    "AbcdPWConstFunction" & "hgVolatilityFunction".
11. LMMTenorStructure is in every class, don't know how to deal with it ???
12. Need to implement the non discret version in Vol structure, for the Mc simulation: more fine than the grid tenor...



To DO tomorrow:
//! 1. McLmm.cpp do simulation
//! 2. use McLmm price Swap/Swaption, don't need to be too general ... 
//! 3. change boost::Matrix to QuantLib Matrix.

TODO:
1. implement HGVolatilityFunction: gFunction.
2. Generalize VolatlityFunction class to calculate covariance in whatever time interval: don't take index(int), but time(double).
3. swaption approximation
4. add shift in simulation, how to treat negative rate in the simulation ?
