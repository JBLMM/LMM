[Q ] Yuan Li said all libors quote are forward Libors of the form L(t,Ti,Tii),
     If then, why we need to do the simulation while this data are already quoted
[R ]

[Q ] In Adrien report formula (5.7), why the geometric brownian second term is  |s_i|^2 instead of |s_iB_i|^2
[R ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[Q4] all simulated Libors are piecewise constant?
[R4] Yes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[Q3] Weights for RebonatoVolatilityCostfunction, how are their formula (reference articles)?
[R3] Will see that after
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Q2] In the ATM Swaption Market Data file.csv, there are not informations about the FixedTenor, FloatTenor
     How we create that ?
[R2] Standard Swaption are always the same tenor structure loat-fixed : For european is 6M-1Y, for us is 3M-6M
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Q1] Libor quoted on the market is spot libor or is forward libor ? 
[R1] There are not spot libor of type L(S,T), it is always L(t,S,T)
