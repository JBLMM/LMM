Here define the common path rules
- Path to the Project
E:\Visual_Studio_Project\Visual_Studio_2012_Project\LunaLMM
- Path to the Boost root library (WITHOUT NUMBER OF VERSION)
E:\DevLib\boost
E:\DevLib\boost\boost
E:\DevLib\boost\lib
- Path to the QuantLib root library (WITHOUT NUMBER OF VERSION)
E:\DevLib\QuantLib
E:\DevLib\QuantLib\ql
E:\DevLib\QuantLib\lib


Open the projet, in ${LUNA_HELPER} filter, open file GenericPath.h
change the two absolute path for input and output corresponding to your computer.
Their relative path are ROOT_LUNA\data\input\ and ROOT_LUNA\data\output\
NOTE : Simply copy the path do not work, you need to replace '\' by '\\'

Right click on CommonLMM, at the left, 

goto VC++ Directories, in Include Directories, add 

\absolute\path\to\boost\
\absolute\path\to\QuantLib\
\absolute\path\to\ThisProject\

goto Linker/Input, add to Additional Dependencies

\absolute\path\to\QuantLib\lib\quantlib.lib

Note that if you build yourselft QuantLib, you may have several versions of quantlib.lib,
choose the appropriate version for setting in each project/properties/Additional Dependencies.

Every thing build will be in the folder VCBuild

Note that file *.suo *.sdf *.vcxproj.user are 'user dependant', that's something of local
Specific user can delete them without loose genericity

For adding new executable projet, add projet type Application, link with CommonLMM by right click
properties/Common Properties/Framework and References/ Add new References/
Then choose CommonLMM
