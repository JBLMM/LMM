TODO:
1. Robonato formula, use L*(t) = E^Q^A (L(t)) other than L(0).
2. Make the shift dependent on time: a_i(t) => then change shifted LMM with a_i -> Piterbarg formulatio: beta_i
   so need to chang the black formula latter to take into account the shift.
3. Test Robonato with shift != 0.
4. Implement the Piterbarg formula. 
5. Add unit-test 
6. need to move fixedLegNPV to better place...
7. MC swap pricing extremly slow ... (compared to FRA): seems the problem of integral of piecewise const fonction HGVolatility.
8. swap rate ~ MC still strange: validate with FRA, but Euler / PC, terminal ~ spot, seems no difference, strange. 
9. get_DeltaTFloatLeg not the same indexation as Libor matrix. To change it. 
10. Robonato/Piterbarg approximation can be further optimized for calibration problem.
11. get_date return a double other than a index, there is no check, it makes the code dangerous, need to delete it. 

12a. Calibration
		- debug for local calibration exact (without use of penalty), calib has to match exactly
		- for Local calibration, find a way to normalize the penalty in order to not depend in nbYear (/nbElementDiag^2)
		- attention to swaption weights, high weight has to attribute to the more liquid swaption
		
12. Remove default constructor and assignment operator of Swap and Swaption, recomeback to precedent version.

14. move initLibor value to LMM model ? (for simplicify equivalentShift, maybe some pricing ? )
15. Make the correlation homogeneous + piecewise constant... 

16. nativeShift is only for the Shifted_HGVolatilityFunction, it should not exist in the base class VolatilityFunction: to remove it and do the cast...

17. OptionType::OptionType vanillaSwaptionType_;  // YY TODO: this should be moved to swap class, now it's in the swaption class
    for this reasong: McLmmBermudanSwaptionPricer don't treat the case Call/put, but always call !!!
	---- McLmmBermudanSwaptionPricer::McLmmBermudanSwaptionPricer::initialize_EV()
     
Problem:
1. Strange behavior of Robonator for longer maturity swaption formula.
2.

Question: 
1. for equivalentShift, PC shceme, should use the same equivalentShift for both predictor  and corrector  ????
2. Rebonator, Piterbard formula can only be used for ShiftedLMM but not betaLMM ?
